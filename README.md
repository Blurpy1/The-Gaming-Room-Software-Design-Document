# The-Gaming-Room-Software-Design-Document
Software Design Document for CS-230 SNHU

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
#Our Client the Gaming Room is a web game based off a popular game show from a few decades ago. The idea is to guess images slowly being rendered on the screen. The Client needed scalable and secure cloud based software to run their game.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
#In this documentation I believe that i really did the UML diagram well, i went back and redesigned it after an inital hiccup in the devolopment. While the first go through didnt work out so well im impressed with my ability to problem solve and fix my mistakes.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
#To develop the code the UML diagram was the most helpful section of this document.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#My evaluation, I did a big revision of the UML diagram as stated before so even though i already did a revision I would go back and maybe decide new columns that may support each category better.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#The entire document is designed around the Client and the user's needs. The user is specifically thought of in the security and quality of life features frequented throughout the decoument.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
#I used a user centric OOP approach that i would continue to use in the future. I used realistic design constraints and cost effectiveness to determine the proper OS based on the clients needs. Continuing to balance the clients and user needs is going to be most important strategy moving forward.
